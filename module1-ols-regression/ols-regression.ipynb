        "In the simplest case, linear regression seeks to fit a straight line through a cloud of points. This line is referred to as the \"regression line\" or \"line of best fit.\" This line tries to summarize the relationship between our X and Y in a way that enables us to use the equation for that line to make predictions.\n",

        "Say that we were trying to create a model that captured the relationship between temperature outside and ice cream sales. In Machine Learning our goal is often different that of other flavors of Linear Regression Analysis, because we're trying to fit a model to this data with the intention of making **predictions** on new data (in the future) that we don't have yet.\n",

        "So if we had measured ice cream sales and the temprature outside on 11 different days, at the end of our modeling **what would be the thing that we would want to predict? - Ice Cream Sales or Temperature?**\n",
        "\n",
        "We would probably want to be measuring temperature with the intention of using that to **forecast** ice cream sales. If we were able to successfully forecast ice cream sales from temperature, this might help us know beforehand how much ice cream to make or how many cones to buy or on which days to open our store, etc. Being able to make predictions accurately has a lot of business implications. This is why making accurate predictions is so valuable (And in large part is why data scientists are paid so well).\n",
